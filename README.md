# Objective of the Project
The accumulation of dust, snow, bird drops etc. on the surface of solar panels reduces the efficiency of the solar modules and hence the amount of produced energy. Monitoring and cleaning solar panels is a crucial task, hence developing an optimal procedure to monitor and clean these panels is very important in order to increase modules efficiency, reduce maintenance cost and reducing the use of resources.

The objective of this project is to investigate the ability of different machine learning classifiers to detect dust, snow, bird drops, physical and electrical on solar panel surfaces with the highest possible accuracy.


# About Dataset
This directory contains six different class folders to classify between. Since the images were scraped from the internet, there is a slight imbalance in the number of images collected.


Clean: This directory has images of clean solar panels
Dusty: This directory has images of dusty solar panels
Bird-drop: This directory has images of bird-drop on solar panels

Electrical-damage: This directory has images of electrical-damage solar panels

Physical-Damage: This directory has images of physical-damage solar panels

Snow-Covered: This directory has images of snow-covered on solar panels
